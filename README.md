## About

This project aims to provide a simple, customizable overlay for Monster Hunter Frontier Z on Windows, with the added bonus of Discord Rich Presence integration. The overlay allows players to keep track of their in-game stats and progress, as well as providing a convenient way to access various tools and resources.

The overlay is highly configurable, with a wide range of options available to suit the needs of individual players and speedrunners alike. It is also constantly being updated and improved, so be sure to check back for the latest features and fixes.

We hope you find this overlay useful and enjoyable, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Happy hunting!

![System Tray options](./demo/systemtray.png)

**It's recommended to start the overlay when you are done loading into Mezeporta.**

If the overlay doesn't seem to load values properly, restart it. If that didn't fix the issue, [please send information here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues).

Additionally, if information from the overlay is wrong or inaccurate (e.g. monster parts labels), feel free to send an issue.

If the monster HP shown is less than what its actual values should be, restart both the game and the overlay. If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load. If issue still occurs, disable Effective HP, otherwise send a bug report if there isn't already one.

[Check more possible future features here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)

## Bugs

- Monster Infos are sometimes outside of the screen (if they don't show at all even if you open the config menu, this is probably your issue)
- With Monster EHP enabled, if you cart, the max EHP turns into the current EHP, along with some other info max values
- Sometimes when exiting Drag and Drop the monster HP information disappears
- Spawning in the same area as the monster doesn't load the information properly. Fix: re-enter area
- Duremudira/Road/Raviente HP not showing. Fix: enable *Always Show Monster Info*, load another quest showing the HP bars (not just the numbers), then retry.
- Monster size values not shown correctly
- Monster HP values are less than the actual values when not loading properly
- Damage numbers over 1000 not working
- Yamas and Berukyurosu information not working

Fully reinstalling the game or .NET dependencies may fix some bugs.

Starting the overlay may take a bit of time because of the dictionaries (*i.e.* **all** in-game gear and items) and other features.

Press `Alt+Enter` twice if your screen resolution got lowered.

If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load.
