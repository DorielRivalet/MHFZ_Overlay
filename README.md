## About

[This project is directly inspired from the overlay created by *suzaku01*](https://github.com/suzaku01/mhf_displayer)

[The theme and color palette used for the application is *Catppuccin Mocha*](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

[The design and icons used in this project are part of the *Material Design Icons* and related components](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

The fonts used is the in-game one, *MS Gothic*, and Source Code Pro for monospaced. This project also uses Font Awesome's fonts.

## Requirements

- [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0 x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.7-windows-x64-installer)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0 x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x86-installer)

## Installation

1. [Get **ALL** of the requirements](#requirements)
2. [Download the latest version from the *Releases*](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/MHFZ_Overlay/releases/latest)
3. Make sure Windows or your antivirus did not delete the `MHFZOverlay.dll` file (because it reads the games memory windows might detect it as a trojan so you might have to get it out of quarantine)
4. Run `MHFZ_Overlay.exe`
5. [Bonk monsters!](https://c.tenor.com/60Tr3Zeg6RkAAAAd/fumo-bonk.gif)

## Hotkeys

- `Shift+F1` Open Configuration
- `Shift+F5` Restart Overlay
- `Shift+F6` Exit

**It's recommended to start the overlay when you are done loading into Mezeporta.**

If the overlay doesn't seem to load values properly, restart it. If that didn't fix the issue, [please send information here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/MHFZ_Overlay/issues).

Additionally, if information from the overlay is wrong or inaccurate (e.g. monster parts labels), feel free to send an issue.

If the monster HP shown is less than what its actual values should be, restart both the game and the overlay. If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load.

## Bugs

- Monster Infos are sometimes outside of the screen (if they don't show at all even if you open the config menu, this is probably your issue)
- With Monster EHP enabled, if you cart, the max EHP turns into the current EHP, along with some other info max values
- Sometimes when exiting Drag and Drop the monster HP information disappears
- Spawning in the same area as the monster doesn't load the information properly. Fix: re-enter area
- Duremudira/Road/Raviente HP not showing. Fix: enable *Always Show Monster Info*, load another quest showing the HP bars (not just the numbers), then retry.
- Monster size values not shown correctly
- Monster HP values are less than the actual values when not loading properly
- Damage numbers over 1000 not working
- Yamas and Berukyurosu information not working
- Daily quests not working

Fully reinstalling the game or .NET dependencies may fix some bugs.
