## About

This project aims to provide a simple, customizable overlay for Monster Hunter Frontier Z on Windows, with the added bonus of Discord Rich Presence integration. The overlay allows players to keep track of their in-game stats and progress, as well as providing a convenient way to access various tools and resources.

The overlay is highly configurable, with a wide range of options available to suit the needs of individual players and speedrunners alike. It is also constantly being updated and improved, so be sure to check back for the latest features and fixes.

We hope you find this overlay useful and enjoyable, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Happy hunting!

- Additional Notes: 1080p/30fps when refresh rate is set to 30. System requirements subject to change during software development.

Please note that these system requirements are estimates and may vary based on your specific hardware configuration.

## Installation

1. [Get **ALL** of the requirements](#requirements).
2. [Download the latest version from the *Releases*](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/releases/latest/download/MHFZ_OverlaySetup.exe).
3. Make sure *Windows* or your antivirus did not delete the file (because it reads the game's memory, *Windows* might detect it as a trojan, so you might have to get it out of quarantine).
4. Run `MHFZ_OverlaySetup.exe` **as Administrator**.
5. [Bonk monsters!](https://c.tenor.com/60Tr3Zeg6RkAAAAd/fumo-bonk.gif).
6. [Be sure to leave some feedback here!](https://forms.gle/hrAVWMcYS5HEo1v7A).

**It's recommended to start the overlay when you are done loading into Mezeporta.**

### DISCLAIMER

If you obtained the mhfz-overlay software from any source other than GitHub releases, please be aware that there are no guarantees that the program has the same code as the version in this repository, nor that it was created by the same individual(s), or that it represents the latest version.

We strongly recommend that you verify the authenticity and integrity of the software by comparing the SHA-256 checksum we provide against the checksum of the software you have obtained. The SHA-256 checksum can be found in the GitHub release notes and can be used to ensure that the software you are using matches the code in this repository. We assume no responsibility for any issues or problems that may arise from the use of software obtained from other sources.

### Quick Troubleshooting

- If the overlay doesn't seem to load values properly, restart it. If that didn't fix the issue, [please send information here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues).

- Additionally, if information from the overlay is wrong or inaccurate (*e.g.* monster parts labels), feel free to send an issue.

- If the monster HP shown is less than what its actual values should be, restart both the game and the overlay. If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load. If the issue still occurs, change the Effective HP Corrector's minimum and maximum thresholds or disable Effective HP, otherwise send a bug report if there isn't already one.

- If you want the overlay to use the least memory possible, you can decide to not open the configuration window. If you want to change settings, then open the configuration window, edit settings, click save and restart the overlay.

- Fully reinstalling the game or .NET dependencies may fix some bugs.

- Press `Alt+Enter` twice if your screen resolution got lowered.

- If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load.

- If you have screen issues when starting the overlay, first press `Alt+Enter` in-game, load the overlay, then press `Alt+Enter` in-game again. Also make sure that the UAC prompts do not cause issues in your computer, and that you have the correct permissions.

- If you are having performance issues, lower the overlay resolution and refresh rate. Also try setting Rendering Mode to Software or Hardware.

## Bugs

- Monster stats are sometimes outside of the screen (if they don't show at all even if you open the config menu, this is probably your issue).
- With Monster EHP enabled, if you cart, the max EHP turns into the current EHP, along with some other stats max values.
- Sometimes when exiting Drag and Drop the monster HP information disappears.
- Spawning in the same area as the monster doesn't load the information properly. Fix: re-enter area.
- Duremudira/Road/Raviente HP not showing. Fix: enable *Always Show Monster Info*, load another quest showing the HP bars (not just the numbers), then retry.
- Monster size values not shown correctly.
- Monster HP values are less than the actual values when not loading properly.
- Damage numbers over 1000 not working.
- Yamas and Berukyurosu information not working.
