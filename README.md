## MHFZ_Overlay

This project is Directly Inspired from the Overlay created by https://github.com/suzaku01


## Usage

1. download the latest version from the Releases
2. install the required .net runtime 
  **BE SURE TO INSTALL x86 VERSION EVEN IF YOUR WINDOWS IS x64** 
  (this is required because MHFZ runs on 32-Bit)
3. Make sure windows did not delete the file (because it reads the games memory windows might detect it as a trojan so you might have to get it out of quarantine)
5. execute the MHFZ_Overlay.exe
