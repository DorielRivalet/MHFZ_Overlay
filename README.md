## About

This project aims to provide a simple, customizable overlay for Monster Hunter Frontier Z on Windows, with the added bonus of Discord Rich Presence integration. The overlay allows players to keep track of their in-game stats and progress, as well as providing a convenient way to access various tools and resources.

The overlay is highly configurable, with a wide range of options available to suit the needs of individual players and speedrunners alike. It is also constantly being updated and improved, so be sure to check back for the latest features and fixes.

We hope you find this overlay useful and enjoyable, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Happy hunting!

## System Requirements

### Minimum

- OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)

### Recommended

- OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Processor: IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-4460 or better
- Memory: 6 GB RAM
- Storage: 500 MB available space
- Additional Notes: 1080p/30fps when refresh rate is set to 30. System requirements subject to change during software development.

Please note that these system requirements are estimates and may vary based on your specific hardware configuration. If you encounter any performance issues or have different hardware specifications, please provide feedback or send an issue for assistance. We appreciate your input in helping us improve the overlay's compatibility with a wider range of hardware setups.

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version from the _Releases_](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/releases/latest/download/MHFZ_Overlay-win-Setup.exe).
2. Make sure _Windows_ or your antivirus did not delete the file (because it reads the game's memory, _Windows_ might detect it as a trojan, so you might have to get it out of quarantine).
3. Run `MHFZ_Overlay-win-Setup.exe` **as Administrator**.
4. [Bonk monsters!](https://c.tenor.com/60Tr3Zeg6RkAAAAd/fumo-bonk.gif)
5. [Be sure to leave some feedback here!](https://forms.gle/hrAVWMcYS5HEo1v7A)

> [!NOTE]<br>
> It's recommended to start the overlay when you are done loading into Mezeporta.

### Misconceptions

1. [Is the overlay malware?](./FAQ.md#is-the-overlay-malware)
2. [Does X overlay feature slow down my computer?](./FAQ.md#does-x-feature-of-the-overlay-slow-down-my-computer)
3. [Does the overlay affect the game?](./FAQ.md#does-the-overlay-affect-the-game)

## Hotkeys

- `Shift+F1` Open Configuration.
- `Shift+F5` Restart Overlay.
- `Shift+F6` Exit.

As an alternative to hotkeys, you can use the system tray options by right-clicking the icon. You can change the hotkeys by opening the Hotkeys window, found in the system tray menu.

![System Tray options](./demo/systemtray.png)

![Hotkeys options](./demo/hotkeys.png)

### Quick Troubleshooting

- Use the Configuration Preset option for quickly setting up your configuration.

![Preset](./demo/preset.png)

- If you have slow performance, lower the refresh rate from 30 to 1.

- If the monster HP shown is less than what its actual values should be, restart both the game and the overlay. If the HP shows 0/1 then change area for it to load. If the issue still occurs, change the Effective HP Corrector's minimum and maximum thresholds or disable Effective HP.

- If you are having issues with the damage numbers when hitting the monster, change Damage Numbers Mode from Automatic to True Damage.

- If you want the overlay to use the least memory possible, you can decide to not open the configuration window. If you want to change settings, then open the configuration window, edit settings, click save and restart the overlay.

- Press `Alt+Enter` if your screen resolution got lowered.

- If you have screen issues when starting the overlay, first press `Alt+Enter` in-game, load the overlay, then press `Alt+Enter` in-game again. Also make sure that the UAC prompts do not cause issues in your computer, and that you have the correct operating system permissions.

- If you are having performance issues, lower the overlay resolution and refresh rate. Also try setting Rendering Mode to Software or Hardware.

- If you are playing on multiplayer, keep in mind that is not fully supported.

- Fully reinstalling the game or .NET dependencies may fix some bugs.

- If the overlay doesn't seem to load values properly, restart it. If that didn't fix the issue, [please send information here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues).

- Additionally, if information from the overlay is wrong or inaccurate (_e.g._ monster parts labels), feel free to send an issue.

## Bugs

- Monster stats are sometimes outside of the screen (if they don't show at all even if you open the config menu, this is probably your issue).
- With Monster EHP enabled, if you cart, the max EHP turns into the current EHP, along with some other stats max values.
- Sometimes when exiting Drag and Drop the monster HP information disappears.
- Spawning in the same area as the monster doesn't load the information properly. Fix: re-enter area.
- Duremudira/Road/Raviente HP not showing. Fix: enable _Always Show Monster Info_, load another quest showing the HP bars (not just the numbers), then retry.
- Monster size values not shown correctly.
- Monster HP values are less than the actual values when not loading properly.
- Damage numbers over 1000 not working.
- Yamas and Berukyurosu information not working.
