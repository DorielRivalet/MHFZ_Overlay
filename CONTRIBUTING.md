## Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dorielrivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues/new?assignees=DorielRivalet&labels=bug&template=BUG-REPORT.yml&title=%5BBUG%5D+-+%3Ctitle%3E). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **reproducible test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- For reporting security vulnerabilities, please go [here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/security/advisories/new)

Alternatively, send an issue [here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues/new) detailing your inquiry about the program.

## Do you want to request a feature?

If you would like to send a feature request, please go [here](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question%2Cenhancement&template=FEATURE-REQUEST.yml&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+-+%3Ctitle%3E)

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [technical documentation](hhttps://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay/tree/main/docs) to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

## Do you intend to add a new feature yourself or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change in a draft pull request and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for feature requests by end-users, bug reports and fixes.

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

This repository has two main sets of documentation: the files in the `docs` folder, which help you learn about the program, and the C# docblocks, which serves as a reference.

You can help improve the technical documentation or the C# docblocks by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest changes.

To do so, make changes to the documentation source files (located here on GitHub) or C# comments in source code. Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the main branch.

When working with documentation, please take into account proper English grammatical structure and punctuation. Strive for Simple English whenever possible.
