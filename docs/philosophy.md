# Philosophy

## Overview

This document outlines the direction and purpose of the MHFZ_Overlay repository and software, and provides insight into the reasoning behind our decisions. Our aim is to promote transparency and inclusivity between developers and end-users.

### Purpose

The MHFZ_Overlay project is primarily intended as an educational endeavor for developers, providing an opportunity to learn about WPF and .NET development, as well as offering utility to players and speedrunners. While the software is provided under the MIT license and comes with no guarantees, we strive to minimize inconvenience for end-users by incorporating UX design and other software development best practices.

### Goals

We believe that access to information about Monster Hunter Frontier Z should be open and inclusive to everyone. As such, we have made the repository and software Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). Specifically, this means that the software is free, open, and can be modified and distributed by anyone.

Here are the meanings of each letter in FLOSS:

- **Free**: the software can be used, studied, modified, and shared without any restrictions.
- **Libre**: the software is free in the sense of freedom, not just in terms of price. This means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.
- **Open**: the source code of the software is available to everyone, and can be inspected, modified, and shared.
- **Source**: the source code is available, which means that users can study, modify, and distribute the software.
- **Software**: refers to computer programs that can be used to perform various tasks on a computer.

### Design Principles

Our aim is to create a simple yet customizable software that provides a good performance for speedrunners and players in general.

### Development Workflow

For an overview of our development workflow, please refer to our [cicd.md](./cicd.md) and [deployment.md](./deployment.md) documents.

### Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository. Our continuous integration tools will alert you to any issues that arise, and the repository owners will provide feedback on pull requests.

### Future Development

While most of the planned features for the software are already implemented, there is always room for improvement. We will continue to work on bug fixes and performance optimization, and may eventually incorporate a website with a database of player time attack records, with their consent.

### Other Considerations

Please note that this document is subject to change, as the philosophy of the project evolves. We do not claim ownership of any Capcom Intellectual Property used in the software, and credits are provided in the [README.md](../README.md) and within the software itself.

### Conclusion

In summary, the MHFZ_Overlay repository and software are intended to provide education, utility, and inclusivity to those interested in Monster Hunter Frontier Z. We believe that access to information should be free and open, and we will continue to work towards these goals.
