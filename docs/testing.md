## Overview

We use unit testing to ensure that our software performs as expected and to identify and address any issues or bugs before release. To facilitate unit testing, we use [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit), a free, open-source, community-focused unit testing tool for .NET.

### Goals

Our primary goal for unit testing is to achieve a code coverage of 90% or above. We use SonarCloud's shields icons to display the percentage of code coverage.
